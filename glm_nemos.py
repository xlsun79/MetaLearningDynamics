        PopulationGLM_CV class
        It fits GLM with n fold cross validation using PopulationGLM function from nemos,
        selects proper regularization values for each response based on deviance of CV held-out data,
        and returns weights and intercepts from models re-fitted with all datapoints in training data with selected regularization values.
        Fit Y with multiple responses simultaneously.
